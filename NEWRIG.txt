How to add a new transceiver to flrig

  Two new files will need to be added:
    . src/include/RIGFAMILY/NEWRIG.h
    . src/rigs/RIGFAMILY/NEWRIG.cxx

  Three files will need to be modified:
    . Makefile.am
       add the references to the two new files
    . src/include/rigs.h
    . src/rigs/rigs.cxx
       add the references to the new rig

  RIGFAMILY might be icom, yaesu, elad, etc.
  NEWRIG might be IC-9999, FT-9999, etc.

Suggest using an existing rig (.cxx, .h) files as a template for
the new rig.  Choose a file that will use similar CAT commands.

After the new files have been added and the three files updated 
you will need to recreate the build scripts.  From the top level
flrig directory:

  $ autoreconf
  $ ./configure
  $ make
