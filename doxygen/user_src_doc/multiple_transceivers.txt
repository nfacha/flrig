/**
\page multiple_transceivers Controlling Multiple Transceivers

You can have multiple instances of flrig running, each controlling a separate
and unique transceiver.  Doing this requires a separate configuration folder
for each target transceiver.  Either start flrig from a command line or
copy the desktop launch icon and then modify it's "target" executable.  In
either case you will be adding a command line parameter

"--config-dir <target-dir>"

Note the double dash.  The <target-dir> will be unique to each supported
transceiver, for example: "C:\Users\<user-name>\flrig.ic7200" on Win-10, 
"/home/<user>/flrig.ic7200" on Linux or OS X.  You will have to configure
each instance with the correct interface parameters.
