\section sEventLog Event Log

Several debugging tools are available in flrig, including the ability to observe code
execution in various parts of the program.
<br><br>
The event log is opened from the "Help/Events" menu item.  It allows you to view the
serial and xmlrpc data exchanges between FLRIG, FLDIGI, xmlrpc transactions,
and the transceiver.

\section sTraceLog Tracing Program Execution

The trace tool sends time annotated data to
both a viewing dialog and a file named "trace.txt" which is written to the flrig files
folder.  The trace tool is very useful to the programmer developing a 3rd party application
using the flrig xmlrpc server.  It may also be used at the request of a support person
assisting the user with transceiver connection or data stream issues.

<ul>
<li> Trace support code - main processing loop execution points.</li>
<li> Trace debug code - replicate the event log debugging output.</li>
<li> Trace rig class code - execution points within a specific transceiver class (not for all).</li>
<li> Trace xml_server code - execution points within the xmlrpc interface code for i/o to/from fldigi.</li>
<li> Trace xmlrpcpp code - sent and received xmlrpc data packets<br>
six levels of detail 0 ... 5 can be specified.</li>
