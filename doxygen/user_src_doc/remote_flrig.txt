\section remote_server Remote Flrig Server

flrig's xmlrpc server interface is always executing.  If the computer that is
connected to the transceiver is on a local area network then another computer
may access that instance of flrig via the xmlrpc interface.  This is an instance
of my FT-710 being controlled on a computer whose network address name is "tk7"

It has been configured to use the default xmlrpc port

\section remote_client Remote Client

A second computer on the local area network has been configured to run an instance
of flrig that connects to the above server.

Note that the title bar indicates that this is a client and not directly connected to the transceiver.

The server address and port must be configured on the client tab before attempting to 
connect to the external xmlrpc server.

The Xcvr tab is then configured to use the xmlrpc interface by selecting "xml_client" in lieu of a
serial port inteface, and pressing the Init button.
