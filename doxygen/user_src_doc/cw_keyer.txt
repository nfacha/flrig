<li>WPM slider selects the keyer speed.</li>
<li>Clear - clears the text in the transmit buffer.</li>
<li>Transmit text will marquee to the left as each character is transmitted.</li>
<li>Send/Pause button toggles sending text.</li>
<li>Macro buttons / function keys load transmit buffer with canned message.

A CQ macro with start/stop (ptt enable/disable): <pre>[CQ CQ DE W1HKJ K]</pre>

Prosign characters can be configured by the user.  The macros and prosign assignments are save in the transceiver prefs file.

The DTR/RTS port can be either
<ul>
<li>shared with the CAT port</li>
<li>shared with the SEP port</li>
<li>shared with the AUX port</li>
<li>a unique serial port configured on this dialog</li>
</ul>

Select either DTR or RTS for the keyline as required by h/w.

Calibrate button sends standard "PARIS " word, WPM times.  Program 
measures actual time to transmit and sets compensation value.  WPM Comp msec 
can be adjusted by user.

Xcvr comp msec is used to increase or decrease each key down interval by 
the specified time interval.

The effect of a -2 msec Xcvr comp adjustment is clearly seen and easily heard.  
It is especially important to correct weight errors introduced by the transceiver 
keying circuits when operating QRQ (high speed CW).  At 80 wpm 2 msec is a significant
part of the target dit interval of 15 msec.

PTT delay is in milliseconds.  Enter a non-zero value to enable a delay 
between the PTT-on and the first CW keyline closure.  The same delay will 
be applied to the last CW keyline closure and PTT-off.

The CW keyer is specifically designed to work with a DTR/RTS keyline to 
emulate the closure of a CW key.  Several transceivers have this capability 
built in to the hardware.  Some expose a separate keying port (FT-991A) and 
some share the CAT serial port (IC-7300).  A simple DTR/RTS keying circuit 
can also provide the h/w interface.  This one provides galvanic isolation:

Inexpensive USB serial-to-CW-keyline devices are available from internet vendors.
